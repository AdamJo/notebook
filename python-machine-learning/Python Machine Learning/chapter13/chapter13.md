# Chapter 13
## This chapter will cover the following topics
* Writing optimized machine learning code with Theano
* Choosing activation functions for artificial neural networks
* Using the keras deep learning library for the fast and easy experimentation

##### Theano
* implement, compile, and evaluate mathematical expressions very efficiently with a strong focus on multidimensional arrays (tensors).
